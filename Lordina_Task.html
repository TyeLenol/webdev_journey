            <h2 style="text-align: left;"><u>Detail of Event:</u></h2>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 17<sup>th</sup> of June 1985 at approximately 2:17 pm, I and my partner, <b>Officer Reid McMillan</b> were dispatched to [Otterson Avenue] in response to a 10-50 called in by a civilian. The caller stated that their vehicle had been struck by the police unit, which appeared to veer erratically and lose control prior to the collision. </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon arrival at the scene, the civilian's vehicle was observed to have sustained impact damage to its side. The police cruiser showed a crushed hood and a bent fender, consistent with a strong frontal collision. 
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, the assigned officer, was absent from the scene. Multiple attempts to contact the officer were made but yielded no response. Civilians in the area were questioned; none reported seeing the officer exit the vehicle. Several speculated that the officer may not have been inside the unit at all at the time of the collision. 
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the scene was being processed, an unrecognized audio was heard playing from the police unit. The sound looped with a calm but unsettling male voice, narrating a story that was not part of dispatch transmissions. 
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officer Trent filed the standard accident report (See Report #0814), after which I proceeded to investigate the interior of the cruiser. Upon entry, it was observed to be devoid of life, silent save for the playing of the audio. There were no signs of a struggle or forced exit. However, the officer's personal effects (See Evidence Report #137) were found on the passenger seat and floor. Further contact attempts to reach the officer were again unsuccessful.
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police radio continued to emit the same anomalous audio. The origin of the recording was <b>untraceable</b>, with no match to any known dispatch channels, frequencies, or radio logs. Upon reporting this, I was directed to retrieve the audio with extreme caution. After removal, it was observed that the audio continued to play despite the device being powered off and physically disconnected from the vehicle. This anomaly was confirmed during evidence intake and led to the classification of the radio as an object of interest (Evidence ID: #R137-A).
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A formal <b>search operation</b> was initiated by <b>Sergeant Wells</b> shortly after. The search covered nearby streets, alleys, and green zones but <b>ultimately failed to locate the officer</b>. With no further evidence and the officer still unaccounted for, the investigation was formally <b>closed and filed as a cold missing persons case</b>.
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only lead retained was the anomalous radio recording. Documented behaviours of the device include:
            <ul>
                <li>The audio plays for a full 20 minutes, uninterrupted. It features an unidentified male voice recounting a personal experience involving escalating psychological distress and eventual disappearance.</li>
                <li>As of June 20<sup>th</sup>, the delay between replays of the audio is 1 hour and 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>The interval between plays reduces by exactly 2 minutes per day, with no discernable trigger or technical explanation.</li>
                <li>Playback persists regardless of power state, location or physical integrity of the original device.</li>
                <li>If the radio is disassembled, playback continues automatically from the last timestamp on whichever nearby device is capable of audio output, including officer bodycams, smartphones, earbuds and even megaphones. The current device of the audio is a smartphone originally belonging to Officer Garrett. The audio has since 'jumped' 5 times.</li>
                <li>There is growing concern about what may occur when the delay interval reaches <b>zero</b>, a point projected to arrive in the near future should the current pattern continue uninterrupted.</li>
            </ul>

                    <strong>[Unknown male]</strong>
                    <p><em>[Angrily]</em></p>
                    <p>I just picked it up. Why is this happening to me?! Who are you?! Where am I? Ahhhhh!!!</p>  
                    <p><em>[Footsteps heard, then sudden stop]</em></p>  
                    <p><em>[Voice now trembling]</em> No. Don't come any closer! No! Noo—</p>    
                  
                    <p><em>[Same voice returns, but calm... distorted]</em></p>  
                    <p>It wasn't free will. I know that now. Free will is a lie. I deserve this.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I was heading out for drinks with a friend after a long shift when I saw it—an old, battered radio. The sun was still out, just enough to catch the glint of the dial. My friend had gone off to grab a snack, and I—I picked it up.</p>    
                    <p>It was playing something faint, but it was playing. That's where everything started. I didn't know that then.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I told my friend <em>[static]</em> about it and showed it to him. He said I should try to sell it, but I was more curious—what was it playing? He looked confused, like he hadn't heard anything at all. He started to say something, then just... stopped.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I went home and forgot about it. Until the next morning. I was making breakfast. One moment the table was empty... the next, it was there again. Same radio. Still battered. Still playing something low and strange. I didn't remember bringing it in. It just—appeared.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I reached out, touched it, and something felt wrong. My skin prickled. I backed off, washed my hands, and tried to ignore it. That's when I noticed... the silence. No cars, no chatter, no sounds from the street.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I live—or lived—on the third floor above a busy intersection. It's never quiet. But now? Nothing. Dead silence. I ran to the window, and suddenly, the noise returned. Like flipping a switch.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I threw the radio out the window. But right before I did—I noticed. It had stopped playing.</p>    
                  
                    <p>A week later, it was on my dining table again. Just... there. Like it had always been. I didn't waste time. I smashed it. Again and again. The heaviest book I had. But when I grabbed my phone to call someone—it wouldn't respond. Just a white screen. Static.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I panicked. Left everything. Slept at a friend's place. Told them it was a blown fuse. Something easy.</p>    
                  
                    <p>That night, I heard knocking. Weak at first. Almost easy to miss. I figured it was a neighbor's door. But then it got louder. And louder. Then, like nothing had ever happened—silence.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I turned on the lights. Ready to yell. But no one else seemed to have heard it. That's when I knew something was wrong. I don't know why, but I called my own number from their home phone.</p>    
                  
                    <p>My ringtone played. Not from the phone. From the other side of the door.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I tried the police. But all I heard was the same phrase, over and over: <strong>"No stars tonight. No stars tonight."</strong></p>    
                  
                    <p>Then another knock. Softer now. But in that silence, it felt thunderous. I stared at the door. No shadow underneath. And then—it stopped. I don't know how I knew, but I did. That was the last knock.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I barely had time to breathe when something slid under the door. My phone. Still white-screened. Still playing static.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I realized the static came in intervals—every ten minutes. It chilled me, but I didn't know why.</p>    
                  
                    <p>Next day, I took the phone. I knew it would follow me either way.</p>    
                  
                    <p>Everything blurred after that. The intervals shortened by two minutes each day. I tried to eliminate audio devices. I even removed my intercom. It didn't matter. I'd hear it on anything—radios, TVs, even other people's phones.</p>    
                  
                    <p>Eventually, I gave up. Bought a cheap phone. At least I knew where it would be.</p>    
                  
                    <p>And the stars—</p>    
                    <p>They were disappearing.</p>    
                  
                    <p>Not just city light pollution. I mean the few I could see—gone. One by one. I told friends. They laughed. Said I was being poetic.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I researched. Found nothing. I don't know what I was expecting. Maybe a name. Maybe an explanation. Maybe a reason this was happening to me and not someone else. But there's no grand meaning. Just... patterns that pretend to make sense.</p>
                  
                  <p>I tried to carry on like nothing was happening, but on the third day I noticed something worse than the static. I met up with a group of friends—people I've known for years. At first, things felt normal. But then they paused in conversation, stared at me, and asked, “Wait, who are you again?” Like they were joking. But no one laughed.  
                  <br><br>
                  One of them looked at their phone, scrolling, and I saw my number—but no name. Just a blank space. No contact picture. Just silence.  
                  <br><br>
                  Later, I checked my old school certificates. The paper was all there, the stamps, the grades… but the name field? Empty. Like I had never existed.  
                  <br><br>
                  Even at work, people would start talking to me normally—asking about the shift, what to do with deliveries—and then stop mid-sentence, confused, like they'd just forgotten what they were saying. Some would glance around like trying to remember who I was, then move on without a word.  
                  <br><br>
                  I stopped trying to explain. I stopped asking if anyone remembered me. Eye contact became rare. Some people would walk right past me like I was a stranger, or even thin air.  
                  <br><br>
                  By the fifth day, I was tired. Not just from running or the noise—I was tired of being erased while breathing.
                  </p>
                  
                    <p>That day, when the intervals hit zero, I went to the park. I thought—if something was going to happen—maybe someone would help.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I took a nap.</p>    
                  
                    <p>When I woke up, the sun was still up. But everyone was gone.</p>    
                  
                    <p>No sounds. No people. Just me. And the static, still playing from the phone I left on the bench.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I walked. Hours, maybe days. No one. Then night fell, and I looked up.</p>    
                  
                    <p>No stars. No moon. Just black.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I wept.</p>    
                  
                    <p>I haven't stopped walking since. I'm hungry, but I can't eat. I'm tired, but I can't sleep. I feel like I'm not even here anymore. Just echoes in a place where meaning has been unmade.</p>    
                  
                    <p>Then I saw them.</p>    
                  
                    <p>At first, I thought they were people. But people don't have <em>that many eyes</em>. Or mouths.</p>    
                  
                    <p>They moved strangely. Like they were sniffing through the dark. I think they're hunting. Me? I don't know. Something.</p>    
                  
                    <p>And then something else found me. It killed me. I felt it.</p>    
                  
                    <p>And then...</p>    
                  
                    <p>...it became me.</p>  
                    </br>
                    <p><em>[End transmission. Static resumes.]</em></p>
